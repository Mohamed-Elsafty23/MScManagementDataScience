# Student Performance Analysis Project ðŸ“š

## Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to understand the various factors that influence academic success. The analysis explores relationships between different variables such as study hours, sleep patterns, stress levels, and their impact on final grades.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains various student-related features including:
- Student demographic information (Age, Gender)
- Academic behaviors (Study Hours, Online Courses, Participation)
- Performance metrics (Assignment Completion, Exam Scores, Final Grades)
- Lifestyle factors (Sleep Hours, Social Media Usage, Stress Levels)
- Learning preferences (Preferred Learning Style, Use of Educational Technology)

## Analysis Methodology
The analysis includes:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Statistical Testing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Correlation Analysis
5. Predictive Modeling
