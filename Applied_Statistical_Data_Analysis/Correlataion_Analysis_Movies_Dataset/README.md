# Movie Dataset Correlation Analysis ðŸŽ¬

## Overview
This project performs a comprehensive correlation analysis on a movies dataset, focusing on understanding relationships between various movie features using point-biserial correlation analysis. The analysis explores connections between binary variables (like movie color and country) and numeric variables (such as budget, IMDB score, and Facebook likes).

## Dataset
The analysis uses the IMDB movies dataset (`movie_metadata.csv`) containing various features:

- Movie attributes (color, duration, title year)
- Social media metrics (Facebook likes for actors, directors, and movies)
- Performance indicators (IMDB score, gross earnings)
- Production details (budget, country, language)
- Audience engagement (user reviews, critic reviews)

## Analysis Methodology
The project employs point-biserial correlation analysis to examine relationships between binary and continuous variables. Key steps include:

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning
2. Binary variable creation
3. Correlation coefficient calculation
4. Statistical significance testing (p-value analysis)

## Key Findings

Some notable correlations discovered:

1. **Color vs Year**: Strong negative correlation (-0.31), indicating older movies tend to be black and white
2. **Color vs IMDB Score**: Positive correlation (0.15), suggesting color movies tend to have slightly higher ratings
3. **Country vs Gross**: Negative correlation (-0.18), showing some regional variations in box office performance
4. **Release Year vs IMDB Score**: Negative correlation (-0.15), indicating older movies tend to have slightly higher ratings
