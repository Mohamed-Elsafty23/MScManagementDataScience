# Movie Dataset Model Reduction Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on applying model reduction techniques to analyze a comprehensive movie dataset. The analysis aims to identify key factors influencing movie success and simplify complex movie data relationships through statistical modeling.

## Dataset Description
The project uses the `movie_metadata.csv` dataset, which contains various features about movies including:
- Movie attributes (color, duration, title year)
- Financial metrics (budget, gross earnings)
- Social metrics (Facebook likes for actors, directors, and movies)
- Critical reception (IMDB scores, number of critic reviews)
- Production details (director name, actor names, language, country)
- Content information (genres, content rating)

## Project Structure
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis
- `movie_metadata.csv`: Dataset file containing movie information
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

## Methodology
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Reduction Techniques Application
4. Statistical Analysis and Interpretation
5. Results Visualization

## Getting Started
