# Spotify Dataset Clustering Analysis ðŸŽµ

## Overview
This project performs cluster analysis on Spotify's dataset of 5000 songs to identify patterns and groupings based on audio features. The analysis helps understand music similarities and can be used for music recommendations and playlist generation.

## Dataset
The project uses the "spotify_5000_songs.csv" dataset containing 5000 songs with their audio features including:
- Acousticness
- Danceability
- Energy
- Instrumentalness
- Valence
- Tempo
- And more...

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration of Spotify audio features
- Implementation of clustering algorithms
- Analysis of song clusters and their characteristics
- Generation of playlists based on cluster analysis
- Visualization of clustering results
